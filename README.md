# Data-Analytics-Lab-3

This is a lab I completed for for my CAP4784 Introduction to Data Analytics class at UNF.

In this lab, we created a simple SQLite db for a business, queried an API, and found matching headlines based off certain keywords from the Google News site.
There are two Python scripts in this repository.
  The first script is for creating the SQLlite DB, inserting data, selecting data, and updating it. (Questions 1-8)
  The second script contains a function to query an API and that prints information about the server response, while also containing an example of how 
  to use the query function. It also contains a function for finding headlines by keywords, which contains also contains an example of how to use the function
  within the script.

Note: The script for questions 1-8 may requirement administrator privileges to successfully write to the DB, assuming it has already been created.
